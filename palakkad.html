          alakkad derives its name from two Malayalam words Pala (a tree Alsteria scholaris) and Kadu (forest), which goes to prove that this place was once a beautiful stretch of forests covered with the sweet-scented flowers of the Pala tree. Palakkad is a land of valleys, hillocks, rivers, forests, mountain streams, and dams. Palakkad is considered as the gateway to Kerala from the north. It can also be visited along with Coimbatore tour packages.
<br><br>
The history of Palakkad dates back to the Paleolithic period; several megalithic relics have been found in the region. During the second and third centuries, the Pallavas of Kanchi probably invaded the present region of Palakkad. The Perumals and then the Utayavars ruled for several centuries. After the rule of Zamorin of Calicut, it was under Hyder Ali, Tipu Sultan and finally became part of Malabar district of the Madras Presidency.

                <p>Silent Valley National Park is a national park located in the northeast corner of Palakkad district in Kerala. It is one of the famous national parks in Kerala, and among the top Palakkad tourist places.

                  Silent Valley National Park is a beautiful representation of the last remaining rain-forest of Kerala. Historically it is a paradigm of people's movement to protect the forest. In 1914, Silent Valley forests were declared as Reserved Forest. It was declared as National Park in 1984 and formally inaugurated in the year 1985. Till 1921, Silent Valley was part of the South Malabar Forest Division with headquarters at Nilambur. In 1921, it came under the control of the Palakkad Forest Division and managed so until 1988.
                  â€ƒ
                  Silent Valley was called 'Sairandhrivanam' as it was the place where Sairandhiri (the secret identity donned by Panchali, from the epic Mahabharata) hid along with her five husbands, the Pandavas, during their exile. The Kunthippuzha River which feeds the entire forest was named after Kunthi, the mother of the Pandavas
