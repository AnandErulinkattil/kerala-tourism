        <p>ozhikode, the name Kozhikode is said to be derived from Koyil (palace) Kotta (fort). This is known by various names, for the Arabs it was Kalikat, for the Chinese it was Kalifo. Tipu Sultan, during the conquest of Malabar, unsuccessfully attempted to change the name of the city to Firozabad. Malayalis have always preferred to call it Kozhikode. With the Arabian Sea on the west and Wayanad Hills on the east, Kozhikode is a popular places to visit in Kerala.
<br><br>
          According to history, Kozhikode was under the Chera rulers until 1122 AD. The city of Calicut came into existence in the 13th century when the Ernad King Udaiyavar conquered the area around Ponniankar and built a fort at a place called Velapuram, now known as Calicut. The Europeans called him Zamorin. Interestingly, the name Calicut is derived from 'calico,' the fine variety of hand-woven cotton cloth said to have originated from this place. Vasco Da Gama landed at the Kappad sea shore with three vessels and 170 men in 1498. A monument is constructed here to commemorate the historical landing.</p>

                <p>Mishkal Masjid (also known as Kuttichira Mosque) situated in Kuttichira was built by an Arab businessman called Mishkal in 13th century.

                  This mosque is built extensively with wood and Italian tiles. The entire structure is supported on 24 carved wooden pillars and there are 47 wooden doors. Nearly 300 people can pray in the ground floor alone. A strong influence of Kerala temple architecture can be seen in the construction of this mosque.
                  
                  A unique feature of the mosque is a square tank, similar to those in temples. A part of the mosque was destroyed by the Portuguese in 1510. The local ruler has helped in defending and repairing the mosque. The mosque was initially a 5 storied, but after the destruction, it remained as a 4 storied structure.<a href="#">read more..</a> </p>
