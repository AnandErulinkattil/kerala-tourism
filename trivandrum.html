However, the main deity remains that of Lord Vishnu and his heavenly consorts namely, Sridevi and Bhudevi. The sacred idol is covered with a special ayurveda mixture that helps in keeping the plaster intact and clean. Devotees donate a large sum of money and precious articles in this temple. The assets are believed to be value around 90,000 crores.  The invaluable donations are kept safe in 6 different cellars.
